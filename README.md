## Overview

This task is used during interviews with technical writers. Its purpose is to give the candidates a challenge to try out GitHub on their own. The expectation is that the candidates read and understand basic glossary arround Git. We wish that the candidates not only complete the task, but also face the technology they will use as technical writers.

## Task


### Step 1

Please **fork** this repository and create a new file in the `tasks` folder. The new file should be named after your GitHub user name. The file extension should be `md` (abcxyz.md) so GitHub knows it includes Markdown syntax which has to be parsed into HTML.

### Step 2

Provide content in this file. It should contain the following sections:

* Explanation of what you think GitHub, using your own words
* Sample documentation

### Step 3

Create a **pull request** back to this repository so we can see what you did, and can perform the review of the task.

## Hints

### Glossary 

We know that GitHub's glossary is a high entry threshold. You can refer to [this](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/GitHub-for-technical-writers-WORKSHOP#glossary) glossary or just use google and/or GitHub docs.

### Content

We strongly encourage you to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that you can mix with HTML, if you really need. This is our standard syntax for writing content.

## Expected outcome

The expected outcome is a [pull request](../../issues) with the file and its content, as described above.
