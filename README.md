## Overview

This task is used during interviews with technical writers. Its purpose is to give a candidate a challenge to try out GitHub or her/his own. Expectation is that the candidate reads and understands most basic glossary arround Git. We don't want candidate to only complete it but also to face the technology she/he is going to face as a technical writer.

## Task


### Step 1

Please **fork** this repository and create a new file in the `tasks` folder. New file should be named after your GitHub user name. File extension should be `md` to let GitHub know it includes Markdown syntax that has to be parsed into HTML.

### Step 2

Provide content in this file. It should contain the following sections:

* Explanation of what you think GitHub, using your own words
* Sample documentation

### Step 3

Create a **pull request** back to this repo so we can see what you did and can perform the review of the task.

## Hints

### Glossary 

We know that GitHub's glossary is a high entry threshold. You can refer to [this](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/GitHub-for-technical-writers-WORKSHOP#glossary) glossary or just use google and/or GitHub docs.

### Content

We strongy encourage you to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that you can mix with HTML, if you really need. This is our standard syntax for writing content.

## Expected outcome

There should be a [pull request](../../issues) including the file and its content, as described above.
